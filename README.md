A power supply for a complete, Raspberry Pi based ADS-B Receiver Setup with independent power rails for the different components.

We sometimes face the problem that a normal Raspberry Pi power supply does not deliver enough power for the Raspi itself, the SDR Stick and possible other components like a display or even an SSD. 

This board can be mounted underneath a Raspberry Pi and deliver stable 5.x V with up to 3 A to it. 

In addition to that it can supply two USB devices and another external device with also 5.x V and 3 A each, provided the input has enough power. 

Each outputs voltage can be calibrated from ~5.1 to ~5.5 V with a trimpot and the two USB outputs are passing USB2 signals from two USB-Mini connectors that can be hooked to the Raspberry Pi. If you need USB3, you can use an external Y-cable. 

There is an INA219 power monitor connected to each output with a 10mÎ© shunt resistor to measure current and voltage. 

A PCA9557 I/O expander allows to switch off power to the USB-ports and the external power.
